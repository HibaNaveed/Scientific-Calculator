## Introduction:

A powerful and intuitive scientific calculator built using Flutter, this app provides various mathematical functions for both standard and scientific calculations.

## Features

The calculator includes the following functions:
- **Trigonometric functions**: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`
- **Logarithmic functions**: `log` (base 10), `ln` (natural logarithm)
- **Exponentials**: `exp` (e^x)
- **Square root**: `√`
- **Basic arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **Constants**: `π` (Pi)
- **Utility buttons**:
  - `AC`: Clears all input
  - `DEL`: Deletes the last input
  - `=`: Evaluates the current expression

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform framework to build the user interface
- **Packages**: Relevant packages for implementing advanced math functions and enhancing UI responsiveness
